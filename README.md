In this project, I employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income 
using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. 

I then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results
and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. 

The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
